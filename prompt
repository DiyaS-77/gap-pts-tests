i will give you few files and then tell you my objective, this is logger.py , next i will share stub_bluetooth.py , utils.py , pts_windows_server.py, grpc_windows_server.py . all these files contain logs related things info, debug , warning logs, error logs, and in our Linux system we have bluetoothd , hci logs, pts logs , etc so already our loger is designed in such a way that it creates a logs folder outside of current working dir and store all logs there, as of now we are no storing in our current implementation , but i want to store all the related logs in the logs folder , with each log folder entry with project name which we give in the cli in client like  gap_and some time stamp as folder inside that logs folder , dont reply to this until i share all the files and say "END OF FILES"
